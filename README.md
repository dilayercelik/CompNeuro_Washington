# CompNeuro_Washington

This repository contains answers to the weekly quizzes of the MOOC "Computational Neuroscience" offered by The University of Washington (Coursera - 8 WEEKS). 

# About this course [(see Coursera)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/computational-neuroscience)

This course provides an introduction to basic computational methods for understanding what nervous systems do and for determining how they function. We will explore the computational principles governing various aspects of vision, sensory-motor control, learning, and memory. Specific topics that will be covered include representation of information by spiking neurons, processing of information in neural networks, and algorithms for adaptation and learning. We will make use of Matlab/Octave/Python demonstrations and exercises to gain a deeper understanding of concepts and methods introduced in the course. The course is primarily aimed at third- or fourth-year undergraduates and beginning graduate students, as well as professionals and distance learners interested in learning how the brain processes information.
